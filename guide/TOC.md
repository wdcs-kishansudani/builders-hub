# Avalanche Developer Guide: Table of Contents

Welcome to the Avalanche Developer Guide! This comprehensive learning path is designed for experienced blockchain developers who are new to the Avalanche ecosystem. The guide will take you from the fundamentals of Avalanche to advanced topics in subnet development and production best practices.

## Recommended Schedule

This guide is designed to be completed over four weeks, with each week focusing on a different level of expertise. However, you can proceed at your own pace and focus on the topics that are most relevant to your interests.

*   **Week 1: Beginner** - Focus on understanding the core concepts of the Avalanche network.
*   **Week 2: Intermediate** - Get hands-on experience with the Avalanche tools and C-Chain.
*   **Week 3: Advanced** - Dive deep into subnets and custom VMs.
*   **Week 4: Professional** - Learn how to build and launch production-ready subnets.
