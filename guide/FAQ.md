# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

This FAQ provides answers to common questions about Avalanche.

## What is Avalanche?

Avalanche is a high-performance, scalable, and customizable blockchain platform that is designed to address the limitations of existing blockchain networks.

## What is the difference between Avalanche and other blockchain networks?

Avalanche is different from other blockchain networks in a number of ways. It uses a novel consensus mechanism that is able to achieve high throughput and low latency. It is also highly customizable, which allows developers to create their own custom blockchain networks, known as Subnets.

## What is a Subnet?

A Subnet is a custom blockchain network that is created by developers to support their specific use cases. Subnets can have their own custom virtual machines (VMs), consensus mechanisms, and token models, making it possible to create a wide range of decentralized applications and services.

## What is the C-Chain?

The C-Chain is the contract chain, which is used for creating and executing smart contracts. It is a fully compatible EVM chain, which means that you can use the same tools and workflows that you are familiar with to build and deploy dApps on the C-Chain.

## What is the P-Chain?

The P-Chain is the platform chain, which is responsible for coordinating validators and managing Subnets.

## What is the X-Chain?

The X-Chain is the exchange chain, which is used for creating and exchanging assets.

## What is the AVAX token?

The AVAX token is the native token of the Avalanche network. It is used to secure the network, pay for fees, and provide a basic unit of account between the multiple Subnets created on the Avalanche network.

## How do I get started with Avalanche?

The best way to get started with Avalanche is to follow the [Quickstart Guide](./00_quickstart.md).
